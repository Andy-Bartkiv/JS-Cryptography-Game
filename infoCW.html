            <p>Cryptography is one of the four Mini-Games playable during the gameplay of the
                classic Microprose / Sid Meier game "Covert Action", released in 1990.</p>
            <p>For more info about original Sid Meier's Covert Action game visit <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Covert_Action" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
                and
                <a href="https://covertaction.fandom.com/wiki/Covert_Action_Wiki" target="_blank">Fandom Wiki</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The protagonist of
                Covert Action is Maximillian (or Maxine) Remington, often referred to simple as "Max" Remington. Max is
                a super-agent working for the CIA, whose task is to almost single-handedly disrupt
                criminal and terrorist activities in various areas around the world.
            </p>
            <p>The Gryptography mini-game itself is pretty straight-forward, and involves switching letters of the
                English Alphabet to decipher the contents of the scrambled message.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Section_3">
            <header>Crypto Workstation</header>
            <div class='img-wrap-right'>
                <img src="assets/CW-img-1.png" alt="The original Cryptography Mini-Game screen">
            </div>
            <p>
                The Mini-Game screen is divided into two parts. In the main (larger) part, the coded message will
                appear. It'll show up as a mess of English letters which make no sense. Depending on the current
                Difficulty setting, the letters may be interspersed with spaces and/or punctuation marks.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the left side is a list of all 26 letters in the English language, shown in bright green. As
                player works to decodes the message, cyan-colored letters will appear next to each of these, to
                denote that player has chosen to replace the original letter with a new one. In addition, a number
                is shown next to each letter to indicate how many times it appears in the message - this can be very
                useful as will be explained below.
            </p>
            <p>
                A clock is also visible at the top-right corner of the screen. This keeps track of the amount of
                time it's taking you to complete the decoding process. There is no actual limit, but of course
                you'll want to spend as little time as possible to complete the message, as wasted time will come
                off your game clock once the mini-game is over.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Section_4">
            <header>The Code Algorithm</header>
            <p>
                The enemy uses a very simple type of code in its transmissions, a Substitution Cipher. In this form
                of encryption, each letter of the alphabet has been substituted for another letter.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, let's take the word "NEEDED". We replace every "E" with a "D", every "D" with a "Y",
                and every "N" with an "X". The result is "XDDYDY".
                The same replacement is used throughout the entire message. Therefore, the words "NED NEEDED ENDED"
                would read "XDY XDDYDY DXYDY".
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a fairly simple code in modern cryptography standards, but it's also easy enough to be
                solvable without frustrating players needlessly. It can be pretty tricky anyway - especially on
                higher difficulty settings, where you have no spaces separating the words!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Section_5">
            <header>Decrypting the Code</header>
            <p>
                When the mini-game begins, the game displays the entire coded message on-screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The contents of the original message are in plain English, and make up intelligible sentences like
                "We of the Red Brotherhood salute you" and so forth. However, since the letters are scrambled, the
                message is not going to be readable until it's decoded.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea is to replace each letter of the coded alphabet with the correct letter, to make sense of
                the message. To replace a letter, simply press the key corresponding to the original letter in the
                coded message, then press the key for the letter you want to replace it with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a replacement has been made, the game will place the "New" letter - in cyan - Below the
                original letter. It will automatically do so for the entire message.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Example:</b>
            </p>
            <div class='img-wrap-right'>
                <img src="assets/CW-img-3.png" alt="Example" style="height: 100%;">
            </div>
            <p>
                1. We see the word "XDDYDY" in the code. We press "D" to select the letter D, and then press "E" to
                replace it with the letter E. The game will now place the letter "E" in cyan below each instance of
                the letter D in the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Next we press "Y" and then "D". The game now shows the letter D in cyan below each instance of
                the letter "Y".
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Finally, we press "X" and then "N". The game will place the cyan letter N below each instance of
                the letter "X" throughout the entire code.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. We've solved a word! And hopefully, we've also made some other words more intelligible and easier
                to decode.
            </p>
            <p>
                We repeat the process, switching each letter in the alphabet with the correct one in order to
                reconstruct the original message.
